/**
 * These are the entity mappings (ActiveRecord / ORM objects) for GithubStats.
 * There's an object for each database table where information is stored.
 * These are all based on CreateReadUpdateDelete.js : http://schizoduckie.github.io/CreateReadUpdateDelete.js
 * CRUD.JS creates automatic SQL queries from these objects and handles relationships between them.
 * It also provides the automatic execution of the create statements when a database table is not available.
